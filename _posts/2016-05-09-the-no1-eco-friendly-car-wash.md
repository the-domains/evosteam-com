The No.1 Eco-Friendly Car-Wash

Did you know that even a Car-Wash can be Eco-Friendly? How?

A regular Car-Wash consumes about 150 litres/car. Our Mobile Unit consumes max 6 litres/car (interior-exterior).

In our Program "Together for a Better World", from every service we provide, 1$ goes to Charity Water to help them beautifully create their work in Africa.
